DOM Node Info
=================
This refers to the properties and methods that allow you to obtain details about a node, such as its name, type, value, and its child elements.

Example:

    .. code-block:: javascript
  
        var nodeName = bookNode.nodeName;
        var nodeValue = bookNode.nodeValue;
