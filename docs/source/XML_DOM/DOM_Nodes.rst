DOM Nodes
=============

In the XML DOM, the document is represented as a tree of nodes. Each node can represent an element, attribute, text, or other types of data.

Types of Nodes:
- Element nodes: Represent XML tags (e.g., `<book>`, `<author>`).

- Text nodes: Contain the text inside the element.

- Attribute nodes: Represent XML attributes within elements.

- Comment nodes: Represent comments in the XML.

Example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <book>
        <title>XML Guide</title>  
        <author>Jane Doe</author>
    </book>
