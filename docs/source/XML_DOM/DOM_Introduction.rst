DOM Introduction
====================
The XML DOM (Document Object Model) is a platform-independent and language-neutral interface for accessing and manipulating XML documents. It represents the document structure as a tree of nodes. This allows you to access, modify, or delete elements, and add new elements.

Example XML:

.. code-block:: xml

    <books>
        <book>
            <title>Book One</title>
            <author>Author One</author>
        </book>
        <book>
            <title>Book Two</title>
            <author>Author Two</author>
        </book>
    </books>
