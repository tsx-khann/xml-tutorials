XML Services
=============

Web services allow different applications or systems to communicate with each other over the internet. They are often used to enable interoperability between systems. The communication can be based on various protocols like SOAP, REST, or XML-RPC. Here's a simple example of how XML is used in web services:

**Example XML Web Service Request:**

.. code-block:: xml

    <request>
        <operation>getPersonDetails</operation>
        <personId>12345</personId>
    </request>
