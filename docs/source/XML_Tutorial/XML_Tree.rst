XML Tree
========

An XML tree structure is a hierarchical representation of XML elements, where each element is a node, and the relationships between elements are represented as parent-child connections.

- The root element is the topmost node in the XML tree.
- Child elements are nested inside parent elements.
- The tree structure allows easy navigation and manipulation of XML data.
